# ARCHIVED! DEPRECATED! WHATEVER
Yeah so Microsoft decided to be a bitch and buy GitHub, which means I've moved over to GitLab. You will no longer be able to see the source code because I made the project **private!** If I make any new projects on GitLab, [you can find me here](http://gitlab.com/akii0008). Thanks!

This entire repo will be archived.
